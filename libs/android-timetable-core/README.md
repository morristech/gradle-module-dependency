# Installation

Include the following in your build.gradle as a dependency:

```gradle
// Check back soon, will update to maven in near future
```

If this fails, make sure to check if you have synchronized your local repositories.

In IntelliJ or Android Studio, you can find this under Settings>Build,Execution,Deployment>Build Tools>Maven>Repositories.


## Benefits

- You only need the name of the plan, the person's name, and a start & end date.
- No need for multi-dimensional arrays
- No need to calculate the X,Y / row,colum
- Pannable in X and Y
- Optimized for best performance
- Multiple items are merged in a single row.


# Usage

###1. Include the layout in your XML

```xml
<com.greasemonk.timetable.TimeTable android:id="@+id/time_table"
                                        android:layout_width="match_parent"
                                        android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
```


###2. Implement your class with IGridItem

```java
public class EmployeePlanItem implements IGridItem
{
	private String employeeName, projectName;
	private TimeRange timeRange;
	
	public EmployeePlanItem() {}
	
	public EmployeePlanItem(String employeeName, String projectName, Date planStart, Date planEnd)
	{
		this.employeeName = employeeName;
		this.projectName = projectName;
		this.timeRange = new TimeRange(planStart, planEnd);
	}
	
	@Override
	public TimeRange getTimeRange()
	{
		return timeRange;
	}
	
	@Override
	public String getName()
	{
		return projectName;
	}
	
	@Override
	public String getPersonName()
	{
		return employeeName;
	}
}
```


###3. Fill the table with data

```java
timeTable = (TimeTable) findViewById(R.id.time_table);
timeTable.setItems(generateSamplePlanData());
```
